# Welcome to the Leaspy software

Leaspy, for Learning Spatiotemporal Pattern in Python, aims to describe the average and individual spatiotemporal trajectories of biological data.

## What can leaspy do for you ?
With leaspy, you may from a longitudinal dataset :

-Estimate an average trajectory  
-Estimate individual parameters  
    -Personalize the model (e.g. reparametrize diagnostic time)  
    -Analysis of its parameters within a cohort (e.g. Male vs Female)  
    -Prediction its future evolution  
-(Work in progress) Synthetic patient/cohort simulation
